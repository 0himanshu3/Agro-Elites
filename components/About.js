      Krishi-help is a platform dedicated to assisting farmers in selling their agricultural produce directly to distributors and customers. By eliminating middlemen, we aim to improve profit margins for farmers and make the distribution process more efficient. This initiative also provides farmers access to cold storage facilities, government schemes, and support to grow their business sustainably.
